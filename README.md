My contribution presents an innovative blockchain-based model that is specifically intended to strengthen data security and integrity, hence addressing the basic issues that are present in modern E- voting systems. Through the careful integration of blockchain technology, my model radically changes the view of E-voting security. By incorporating immutability, transparency, and decentralised consensus methods into the heart of electronic voting systems, this work seeks to strengthen election processes. The application of smart contracts within this infrastructure solidifies the authentication process, establishing a resilient defense against potential cyber threats and unauthorized access.
